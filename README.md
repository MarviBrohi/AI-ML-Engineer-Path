**Title**
AI-ML-Engineer-Path

**About**
A Structured learning and project-based journey in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, starting from Python fundamentals to advanced topics such as Deep learning, MLOps, Generative AL, and Agentic AI. The Focus is on practical learning, clean code, and end-to-end deployable projects.

**Leaning Roadmap**
. Python for Data Science 
. Exploratory Data Analysis and AutoEDA
. Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering 
. Supervised and Unsupervised Machine learning
. Advanced ML and AutoML
. Deep learning(ANN, CNN, RNN, Transformers)
. MLOps, NLP, and Computer Vision
. Generative AI and Agentic AI
. End-to-End ML projects with Streamlit Deployment 

**End-to-End Workflow**
Data Gathering → EDA → Preprocessing → Model Training → Serialization → Streamlit UI → GitHub → Cloud Deployment

**Tech Stack**
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Streamlit
